Today you will write a series of iterator functions for trees.

    - breadthFirst
    - depthFirstPreOrder
    - depthFirstPostOrder

Each of these function will take a node of the tree and a callback. The function will iterate through the child nodes, calling the callback function on each of them. The difference between them is the order in which they iterate.

Time Complexity

BreadthFirst - O(n)
DepthFirst - O(n)

Space Complexity

BreadthFirst - O(n)
DepthFirst - O(n)
