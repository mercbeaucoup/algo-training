Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

//if the array is length 1 return ... ???
//if the array is length 2 return ... ???
//declare a product variable
//if the array is length 3
//loop over the numbers
//multiply product by array[i]
//loop over the array again using map or a for loop
//divide the product by array[i]
//replace array[i] with the result
//return the array
