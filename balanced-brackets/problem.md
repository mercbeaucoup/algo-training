Write a function that determines whether an input string has balanced brackets.

You are given an input string consisting of bracketsâ€”square [ ], round ( ), and curly { }. The input string can include other text. Write a function that returns either true if the brackets in the input string are balanced or false if they are not. Balanced means that any opening bracket of a particular type must also have a closing bracket of the same type.

An empty input string or a string without brackets can also be considered "balanced".
