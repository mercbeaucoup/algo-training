1. Given a linked list with .value (first value) and .next (remaining list) interface, log the values in reverse order.
2. Write a function which returns a new reversed linked list.

Restrictions:

- no mutation at all, 100% pure (except for console.log in Part 1)
- no built-in data structures or methods, only variables / functions / control flow
- no arrays, no objects except the (immutable) list nodes themselves
- no iterables or iteration protocol (for-of, ...)

//use recursion to iterate through the linked list and print each node
